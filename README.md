# Background

Legacy is a multi-region automobile retailer and distributor that sells new and used cars across several dealer regions. Over the last few quarters Legacy has expanded its product mix (multiple body styles, colours and brands) and opened several dealer locations in different regions. With increased inventory complexity and a push to improve profitability, Legacy’s leadership needs a single source of truth to monitor sales performance, spot trends, and quickly take corrective actions. 

Current pain points include: 

• Leadership doesn’t have easily accessible, consolidated KPIs (YTD / MTD sales, YTD average price, cars sold) displayed in a clear format for monthly reviews. 

• Regional managers lack a fast way to compare dealer-region performance and identify underperforming areas. 

• Product and pricing teams cannot quickly assess which body styles, colours, or companies drive revenue or margin changes over time. 

• The operations team needs a transaction-level details view to trace individual sales (for audits, warranty follow-ups, or customer service inquiries).

To address these gaps, Legacy has commissioned a dynamic Power BI dashboard that provides both high-level KPI monitoring and drill-through detail for transaction-level analysis.
